This project is a frontend-only Hospital Management System developed using HTML and CSS. It features multiple pages including Home, About Us, Booking, Contact, Login, and Services. Each page is fully styled and provides a smooth navigation experience. A special page (projectb10.html) simulates real-world hospital functionalities such as patient registration, appointment booking, a banking-style UI for deposits and withdrawals, a billing system, a list of available doctors, and an admin dashboard. The project also includes interactive form validation and a light/dark theme toggle. This system demonstrates core web development concepts like semantic HTML, CSS styling, layout design, and basic JavaScript interactivity. It was created as part of an internship/academic project to showcase practical frontend development skills.
